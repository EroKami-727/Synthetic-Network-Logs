# Synthetic-Network-Logs
Just a little code to make some synthetic data for another program. The log patterns are taken from wireshark

# How to use
Just copy paste in vscode, install the libraries. Change the directory in the bottom of code according to your desktop.

The format and pattern is taken mostly from wireshark but also modified to my own workings.
